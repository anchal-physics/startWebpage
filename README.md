# startWebpage
Start a static jekyll webpage with a blog. This repo is aimed at providing a
one command solution to starting a webpage using github pages and jekyll. This
creates a public website which is hosted for free.

To use, copy and paste this command in your terminal:
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchal-physics/startWebpage/main/startWebpage.sh)"
```

You would be prompted to tell a location for your project but it would be
simplest to just cd to the desired location first and then run the above
command.
